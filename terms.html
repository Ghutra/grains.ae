<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>These Terms of Service govern your use of grains.ae (the "Site") operated by Grains Hub under Ghutra Goods Wholesaler LLC ("we", "us", or "our"). By accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <li>Direct B2B wholesale supply of grains and related commodities, where applicable, from us to you as the buyer</li>
</ul>
<p>We are a licensed wholesaler and information provider. We do <strong>not</strong> operate as a public marketplace or a platform for third parties to trade with each other.</p>

<h2>3. Our role</h2>
<p>All commercial sales made through or in connection with grains.ae are direct B2B transactions between you and Ghutra Goods Wholesaler LLC, unless explicitly stated otherwise in a written agreement.

<h2>6. Transactions and supply</h2>
<p>Where you choose to enter into a purchase with us, the terms of that transaction (including pricing, specifications, quantity, delivery, and payment) will be agreed separately, for example through a written quotation, contract, proforma invoice, or purchase order. We are responsible for the quality and legality of goods we sell as a licensed wholesaler, subject to the agreed contractual terms and applicable law.
